Figure 2: 12 controls
???
of ???
in the ??? system.
In panel A, we show the response of teta
, in units of [0, 1000]
/???,
as .2 increases.
Several values of \alfa are shown.
Using ???
allows us to infer ???
from observations of ???
in ???.
In panel B, we compare the resulting estimations of ???
in units of cm/s.
Data are shown for two conditions, wild type and formin knockout.
Overlaid curves are best fits of the precessive model
and the one stage reduction model.
